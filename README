MySQL::Diff is Perl module for comparing the table structure
of two MySQL databases.

Shameless plug
--------------

This software was originally written as part of the
<http://www.guideguide.com/> project.  If you like hacking Perl in a
cool environment, come and work for us!

Prerequisites
-------------

This suite requires Perl 5.6.0 or higher, and the Class::MakeMethods::*
suite available from CPAN.

Installation
------------

See INSTALL.

Documentation
-------------

See: http://adamspiers.org/computing/mysqldiff/

At some stage I'll get round to including proper POD-format
documentation and tests.  (Patches welcome ;-)

Support
-------

Questions, bug reports, useful code bits, and suggestions for
MySQL::Diff should just be sent to me at <mysqldiff@adamspiers.org>.
