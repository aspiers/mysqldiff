Reported by users but unconfirmed:
==================================

  * If '-P1 3337' is one of the arguments it doesn't seem to get
    passed to the arguments for mysqldump (according to the
    debugging).  [Darrell Taylor]

Others
======

  * You can't specify which database to connect to for creating
    temporary tables.

  * Things probably break if you use --password or
    -p without a parameter.

  * The remote authentication code is barely tested, and hence
    probably broken.

All easy to fix but I'm so short on time!  Patches welcome ...
